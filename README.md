##README

In this project, I am converting the Game of Score (https://github.com/dschalk/score2) Javascript over to React.js. So far, this is working out beautifully. Braodcast data is being displayed in all participating browsers without flux, reflux, alt or any such dispatch helpers. Websockets 'onmessage' filters incoming data and updates the player interface with each new dice roll initiated by any other player. Eventually, players will be able to divide into discreet groups as they do in 'dschalk/score2'.
